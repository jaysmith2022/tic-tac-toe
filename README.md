## Preview of App:





## Context:
This project was a fun way to test my creative side with the added difficulty of finding away to make that visual to the user while also having functionality. I had to do a lot of research on how I added some features such as the audio and moving players on the home page. It was a little tricky but to get the loading page to work correctly, but in the end it turned out well.

## Learning Goals:
Write clean, DRY JavaScript using functions and iterations. Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding to my data model and updating elements on the DOM

## Wins + Challenges:
Wins: Technical Wins included: Setting up the errors for someone clicked on a spot that was already taken. Also, finding a way to lock the squares so someone couldn't click on them. I ended up using 'disabled' as a way to keep them from being clicked. I also used the data-section that Travis suggested from my last project and it worked amazing! I first started out with a function with no less than 13 if statement, but I quickly realized that I couldn't get it to fully function how I wanted it to. 
Challenges included: Almost all of this was challenging. I would say the hardest part for me was updating the DOM. Usually that is the easy part, and it some instances it was, but updating the wins was sometimes a pain.
